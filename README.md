# CollisionAvoidanceViz
3D visualization in Python of 2525 satellite trajectories computed by a novel collision-avoidance algorithm.

This is a project that I did for the Aerospace Controls Laboratory at UIUC. 

The research question was: Is it possible to co-ordinate a swarm of nano-satellites with some rules without them colliding with each other?

Saptarshi Bandyopadhyay, a graduate student who was advised by Professor Soon-Jo Chung, created a Matlab program that computed the positions of 5000 "nano-satellites" from the collision avoidance algorithm.

I created a Python script that was run in Blender3D to render a video of this algorithm.

The actual data files are not provided for confidentiality reasons. However, I have provided my contribution, the Python script used for the 3D visualisation.
